                <h1 id="mmo-space-simulations-reveal-an-emerging-future-for-the-video-game-market">MMO space simulations reveal an emerging future for the video game market</h1>
<p>The most crowdfunded video game on the planet is Star Citizen. When it finally releases, it will be a MMO space simulation, with a persistent galaxy that is populated by players.<br />
Star Citizen is checking a lot of video game industry boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s always online, therefore it is hard to pirate.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a game as a service (a GaaS) and can be changed and easily adapted to different market push and pull effects.</li>
<li>In theory it could be free to play (and often is through &ldquo;free flight events&rdquo;), therefore it has a low barrier to entry &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; but since a space sim is not playable successfully without a ship and ships cost real money, monetization is baked in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Star Citizen has a lot of overlap with Elite: Dangerous, EVE Online, and No Man&rsquo;s Sky, though all of these games focus on different aspects of the same core concept. The differing success of the current iteration of space sims and their continually growing scope reveals an underlying market thesis for video games, which wouldn&rsquo;t feel out of place in cyberpunk media from the 90&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Space sims are an old genre with Elite (precurso to the current Elite: Dangerous) and Wing Commander (from the creator of Star Citizen) going back to the 80&rsquo;s and early 90&rsquo;s. They have always been limited by available hardware: Their goal is to simulate the physics of celestial bodies and space ships at the same time as simulating the economics of trade routes and commodities trading, while also telling an engaging emerging story, which needs to be different for every player. This would be difficult enough. Though additionally trying to do all of this online and persisting the effects players have on their surrounding has been a sign of hubris at best and simply an unrealized vision at worst. The initial failure of No Man&rsquo;s Sky demonstrated the scope of these efforts and the accompanying problems quite effectively.</p>
<p>At the same time space sims - like a lot of other simulation games - have a difficult incentive structure not unlike thinking based professions &ldquo;in the real world&rdquo;: It can be highly rewarding spending time in a well working universe, simulating the lives of normal people in franchises like Star Trek or Star Wars. But earning virtual money through menial tasks and saving up to buy better ships, to do more menial tasks more efficiently seems an awful lot like work. Still, games as a job have a long tradition especially with MMORPGs.</p>
<p>EVE Online has 30K people playing on a normal day and a lot more, when massive wars break out. Elite: Dangerous has another 30K players on Steam alone and probably more on consoles. People handed over 300 million USD collectively (this number is still rising) to let Star Citizen&rsquo;s developers build them a universe to work in. And this are only the biggest space sims at the moment.</p>
<p>A lot of currently active GaaS like Battle Royale Games, classic MMORPGs, and non-conventional RPG-lites have a difficult incentive structure with proceeds of menial tasks counting towards a complicated - and often real-life-money-intensive - meta game. Even long running games of skill like online ego shooters are implementing similar meta games, while mobile games had them for a long time.</p>
<p>All of this development flies in the face of the accepted role of video games as &ldquo;short-term escapism&rdquo; not unlike movies or books, which help winding down by building a fictional world and inviting the viewer or reader for a limited amount of time to forget about the real world until the movie ends or the book is finished. In this case value for the consumer is created in a similar fashion to vacations.</p>
<p>Space sims and other GaaS seem to contain a different value proposition - and make escapist ficitonal media seem cynical in comparison. These emerging games aren&rsquo;t about fleeing the harsh realities of a complex world, but to embrace &ldquo;another reality&rdquo;, which somehow seems to be more desirable for its players. This could be compared to taking a vacation from being exhausted by one job, by doing another job.</p>
<p>There is a concurrent trend, which seems to be diametrically opposed to real life experiences, though still mimmicing reality to the letter: blockchain based cryptocurrencies were partially launched to be an alternative to a financial system, susceptible to manipulation and further complicated by intransparency, though crypto has become susceptible to manipulation and getting ever more complicated as well.</p>
<p>I think the virtual currency from GaaS could become digital currency (cryptocurrency, even), which can be traded for fiat (Eve: Online already experimented with fiat-exchangeable virtual currency). A lot of non-gaming apps are already developing attached cryptocurrencies, native to the app, but still fiat-exchangeable. At the same time a lot of people around the globe are earning their livelihood connected to the consumption of video games at this very moment. For example e-sports contestants - obviously - but also gaming influencers, especially live streamers.</p>
<p>In the end every added value has to be consumed by someone. Where and how this value is consumed has changed dramatically over the last few centuries and with graphics and even VR-technology advancing I think it is not unreasonable to assume a future, where value is created (read: jobs are performed) completely inside GaaS, since this is, where value is already consumed. This future wouldn&rsquo;t be unlike The Matrix and how this could work can already be observed in space sims.</p>
